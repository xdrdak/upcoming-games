# Game Release Calendar

A little svelte app that displays a list of upcoming games.

Only PS4 and Switch games, since those are the consoles I have and the app was built for me.

## Caveats

- List may or may not be up to date.
- External IGDB link may or may not give the right game, since we're very much praying that the kebab case conversion of a game gives out a good url.

## TODO

Here's a laundry list of things needed before I consider this app done and ready to be released into the wild.

- [] Tests. Oh boy do I need tests...
- [] Responsive view
- [] Google Auth to persist favourites via accounts
- [] Week View
- [] Group games by console
- [] Group games on calendar day
- [] Digest Xbone Games
- [] Digest PC Games

## Future Ideas

#### Cost Tracker

Based on your favourites list, we will attempt to figure out how much a month would cost.

#### Export Favs

Show your favourites list to your friend so they can silently judge you.

#### Better IGDB integration

No need to redirect to an external site! Just click and get some info of the game directly in the app.
